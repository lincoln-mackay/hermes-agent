/**
 * window — pure transcript-windowing math (slices S1+S2 of docs/plans/
 * opentui-transcript-windowing.md, issue #27). The view (view/transcript.tsx)
 * replaces out-of-window rows with EXACT-HEIGHT empty boxes (1 yoga node, no
 * text buffers / native handles), so the mounted set stays ~3 viewports of
 * rows regardless of transcript length. This module is the testable core:
 *
 *  - `computeWindow` — which row keys must be mounted for a given scrollTop:
 *    rows intersecting [scrollTop − margin, scrollTop + viewport + margin)
 *    over CUMULATIVE row heights (exact recorded heights; a line-count
 *    estimate stands in for never-measured rows), plus the never-window rows
 *    (streaming/live) and the bottom K rows (sticky-bottom region). With
 *    `pinnedBottom` (S2) the window anchors to the BOTTOM of the content
 *    instead of `scrollTop`: during burst appends / a resume snapshot the
 *    sticky pin will land at the new bottom, but layout (and therefore
 *    scrollTop) lags the store — anchoring to the cumulative content bottom
 *    adjudicates appended rows immediately instead of one frame late.
 *  - `shouldRecompute` — the hysteresis gate (≥ ¼ viewport via
 *    `hysteresisFor`): a computed window only changes once scrollTop has
 *    moved ≥ hysteresis from the anchor it was computed at, so swaps don't
 *    thrash at window edges.
 *  - `correctionIsLegal` — the jank rule for spacer-height corrections:
 *    a correction may only touch rows fully ABOVE the viewport (the caller
 *    compensates scrollTop in the same frame — automatic when bottom-anchored
 *    via the sticky pin) or fully BELOW it (invisible by definition). Anything
 *    intersecting the viewport would visibly move content: forbidden.
 *  - `estimateMessageHeight` — the cheap line-count estimate for rows that
 *    have never been measured (resume history above the viewport). A wrong
 *    estimate is fixed by remount (scrolling near) or by the S2 idle measure
 *    pass, both governed by the jank rule.
 *  - `edgeMeasureBatch` (S2 — design §4, the SIMPLE choice): @opentui/core
 *    cannot lay a renderable out without parenting it into the live tree
 *    (layout is the tree's Yoga pass), so true offscreen measurement isn't
 *    available. Instead the idle pass mounts a small batch of never-measured
 *    rows nearest the bottom window edge — they are the next to be seen when
 *    the user scrolls back — records their exact heights, and lets the next
 *    window recompute swap them back to (now exact) spacers. Estimates far
 *    from the window stay estimates until the march reaches them.
 *  - `windowRowStats` — a DEV counter (current / peak simultaneously-mounted
 *    real rows) the integration tests assert against and the bench can read
 *    (transcript.tsx exposes it on globalThis behind HERMES_TUI_WINDOW_STATS).
